I created this on my maccbook.
I am going to create a ggit repo and push to GitHub.
Then I want to open this on my iMac, make changes and push to GitHub.
Will this work?

Second commit.

Now I am on the iMac.  I just uploaded GC's Batty to Netlify.
Just going to try and push this to GitHub

Yes, it did work.  It asked for my user.  The password - this is the key I generated.  Note, when pasting in it doesn't display, but it's there.

Don't forget, in order to push you need this: git push -u origin main
